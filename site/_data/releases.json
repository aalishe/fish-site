A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"`fish-3.1.1.tar.gz.asc`\".*\r\n\r\nThis release of fish fixes a number of major issues discovered in fish 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n- Commands which involve `. ( ... | psub)` now work correctly, as a bug in the `function --on-job-exit` option has been fixed (#6613).\r\n- Conflicts between upstream packages for ripgrep and bat, and the fish packages, have been resolved (#5822).\r\n- Starting fish in a directory without read access, such as via `su`, no longer crashes (#6597).\r\n- Glob ordering changes which were introduced in 3.1.0 have been reverted, returning the order of globs to the previous state (#6593).\r\n- Redirections using the deprecated caret syntax to a file descriptor (eg `^&2`) work correctly (#6591).\r\n- Redirections that append to a file descriptor (eg `2>>&1`) work correctly (#6614).\r\n- Building fish on macOS (#6602) or with new versions of GCC (#6604, #6609) is now successful.\r\n- `time` is now correctly listed in the output of `builtin -n`, and `time --help` works correctly (#6598).\r\n- Exported universal variables now update properly (#6612).\r\n- `status current-command` gives the expected output when used with an environment override - that is, `F=B status current-command` returns `status` instead of `F=B` (#6635).\r\n- `test` no longer crashes when used with \"`nan`\" or \"`inf`\" arguments, erroring out instead (#6655).\r\n- Copying from the end of the command line no longer crashes fish (#6680).\r\n- `read` no longer removes multiple separators when splitting a variable into a list, restoring the previous behaviour from fish 3.0 and before (#6650).\r\n- Functions using `--on-job-exit` and `--on-process-exit` work reliably again (#6679).\r\n- Functions using `--on-signal INT` work reliably in interactive sessions, as they did in fish 2.7 and before (#6649). These handlers have never worked in non-interactive sessions, and making them work is an ongoing process.\r\n- Functions using `--on-variable` work reliably with variables which are set implicitly (rather than with `set`), such as \"`fish_bind_mode`\" and \"`PWD`\" (#6653).\r\n- 256 colors are properly enabled under certain conditions that were incorrectly detected in fish 3.1.0 (`$TERM` begins with xterm, does not include \"`256color`\", and `$TERM_PROGRAM` is not set) (#6701).\r\n- The Mercurial (`hg`) prompt no longer produces an error when the current working directory is removed (#6699). Also, for performance reasons it shows only basic information by default; to restore the detailed status, set `$fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status`.\r\n- The VCS prompt, `fish_vcs_prompt`, no longer displays Subversion (`svn`) status by default, due to the potential slowness of this operation (#6681).\r\n- Pasting of commands has been sped up (#6713).\r\n- Using extended Unicode characters, such as emoji, in a non-Unicode capable locale (such as the `C` or `POSIX` locale) no longer renders all output blank (#6736).\r\n- `help` prefers to use `xdg-open`, avoiding the use of `open` on Debian systems where this command is actually `openvt` (#6739).\r\n- Command lines starting with a space, which are not saved in history, now do not get autosuggestions. This fixes an issue with Midnight Commander integration (#6763), but may be changed in a future version.\r\n- Copying to the clipboard no longer inserts a newline at the end of the content, matching fish 2.7 and earlier (#6927).\r\n- `fzf` in complex pipes no longer hangs. More generally, code run as part of command substitutions or `eval` will no longer have separate process groups. (#6624, #6806).\r\n\r\nThis release also includes:\r\n- a number of changes to improve macOS compatibility with code signing and notarization;\r\n- a number of improvements to completions; and\r\n- a number of content and formatting improvements to the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.0.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.1.0 and 3.1b1.\r\n\r\n## Errata for fish 3.1\r\n\r\nA new builtin, `time`, was introduced in the fish 3.1 releases. This builtin is a reserved word (like `test`, `function`, and others) because of the way it is implemented, and functions can no longer be named `time`. This was not clear in the fish 3.1b1 release notes.",

A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"`fish-3.1.0.tar.gz.asc`\".*\r\n\r\nCompared to the beta release of fish 3.1b1, fish version 3.1.0:\r\n- fixes a regression where spaces after a brace were removed despite brace expansion not occurring (#6564)\r\n- fixes a number of problems in compiling and testing on Cygwin (#6549) and Solaris-derived systems such as Illumos (#6553, #6554, #6555, #6556, and #6558); \r\n- fixes the process for building macOS packages; and\r\n- contains some improvements to the documentation and a small number of completions.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.0.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.1b1 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# fish 3.1b1 (released January 26, 2020)\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements and fixes\r\n- A new `$pipestatus` variable contains a list of exit statuses of the previous job, for each of the separate commands in a pipeline (#5632).\r\n- fish no longer buffers pipes to the last function in a pipeline, improving many cases where pipes appeared to block or hang (#1396).\r\n- An overhaul of error messages for builtin commands, including a removal of the overwhelming usage summary, more readable stack traces (#3404, #5434), and stack traces for `test` (aka `[`) (#5771).\r\n- fish's debugging arguments have been significantly improved. The `--debug-level` option has been removed, and a new `--debug` option replaces it. This option accepts various categories, which may be listed via `fish --print-debug-categories` (#5879). A new `--debug-output` option allows for redirection of debug output.\r\n- `string` has a new `collect` subcommand for use in command substitutions, producing a single output instead of splitting on new lines (similar to `\"$(cmd)\"` in other shells) (#159).\r\n- The fish manual, tutorial and FAQ are now available in `man` format as `fish-doc`, `fish-tutorial` and `fish-faq` respectively (#5521).\r\n- Like other shells, `cd` now always looks for its argument in the current directory as a last resort, even if the `CDPATH` variable does not include it or \".\" (#4484).\r\n- fish now correctly handles `CDPATH` entries that start with `..` (#6220) or contain `./` (#5887).\r\n- The `fish_trace` variable may be set to trace execution (#3427). This performs a similar role as `set -x` in other shells.\r\n- fish uses the temporary directory determined by the system, rather than relying on `/tmp` (#3845).\r\n- The fish Web configuration tool (`fish_config`) prints a list of commands it is executing, to help understanding and debugging (#5584).\r\n- Major performance improvements when pasting (#5866), executing lots of commands (#5905), importing history from bash (#6295), and when completing variables that might match `$history` (#6288).\r\n\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n- A new builtin command, `time`, which allows timing of fish functions and builtins as well as external commands (#117).\r\n- Brace expansion now only takes place if the braces include a \",\" or a variable expansion, meaning common commands such as `git reset HEAD@{0}` do not require escaping (#5869).\r\n- New redirections `&>` and `&|` may be used to redirect or pipe stdout, and also redirect stderr to stdout (#6192).\r\n- `switch` now allows arguments that expand to nothing, like empty variables (#5677).\r\n- The `VAR=val cmd` syntax can now be used to run a command in a modified environment (#6287).\r\n- `and` is no longer recognised as a command, so that nonsensical constructs like `and and and` produce a syntax error (#6089).\r\n- `math`'s exponent operator, '`^`', was previously left-associative, but now uses the more commonly-used right-associative behaviour (#6280). This means that `math '3^0.5^2'` was previously calculated as '(3^0.5)^2', but is now calculated as '3^(0.5^2)'.\r\n- In fish 3.0, the variable used with `for` loops inside command substitutions could leak into enclosing scopes; this was an inadvertent behaviour change and has been reverted (#6480).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n- `string split0` now returns 0 if it split something (#5701).\r\n- In the interest of consistency, `builtin -q` and `command -q` can now be used to query if a builtin or command exists (#5631).\r\n- `math` now accepts `--scale=max` for the maximum scale (#5579).\r\n- `builtin $var` now works correctly, allowing a variable as the builtin name (#5639).\r\n- `cd` understands the `--` argument to make it possible to change to directories starting with a hyphen (#6071).\r\n- `complete --do-complete` now also does fuzzy matches (#5467).\r\n- `complete --do-complete` can be used inside completions, allowing limited recursion (#3474).\r\n- `count` now also counts lines fed on standard input (#5744).\r\n- `eval` produces an exit status of 0 when given no arguments, like other shells (#5692).\r\n- `printf` prints what it can when input hasn't been fully converted to a number, but still prints an error (#5532).\r\n- `complete -C foo` now works as expected, rather than requiring `complete -Cfoo`.\r\n- `complete` has a new `--force-files` option, to re-enable file completions. This allows `sudo -E` and `pacman -Qo` to complete correctly (#5646).\r\n- `argparse` now defaults to showing the current function name (instead of `argparse`) in its errors, making `--name` often superfluous (#5835).\r\n- `argparse` has a new `--ignore-unknown` option to keep unrecognized options, allowing multiple argparse passes to parse options (#5367).\r\n- `argparse` correctly handles flag value validation of options that only have short names (#5864).\r\n- `read -S` (short option of `--shell`) is recognised correctly (#5660).\r\n- `read` understands `--list`, which acts like `--array` in reading all arguments into a list inside a single variable, but is better named (#5846).\r\n- `read` has a new option, `--tokenize`, which splits a string into variables according to the shell's tokenization rules, considering quoting, escaping, and so on (#3823).\r\n- `read` interacts more correctly with the deprecated `$IFS` variable, in particular removing multiple separators when splitting a variable into a list (#6406), matching other shells.\r\n- `fish_indent` now handles semicolons better, including leaving them in place for `; and` and `; or` instead of breaking the line (#5859).\r\n- `fish_indent --write` now supports multiple file arguments, indenting them in turn.\r\n- The default read limit has been increased to 100MiB (#5267).\r\n- `math` now also understands `x` for multiplication, provided it is followed by whitespace (#5906).\r\n- `math` reports the right error when incorrect syntax is used inside parentheses (#6063), and warns when unsupported logical operations are used (#6096).\r\n- `functions --erase` now also prevents fish from autoloading a function for the first time (#5951).\r\n- `jobs --last` returns 0 to indicate success when a job is found (#6104).\r\n- `commandline -p` and `commandline -j` now split on `&&` and `||` in addition to `;` and `&` (#6214).\r\n- A bug where `string split` would drop empty strings if the output was only empty strings has been fixed (#5987).\r\n- `eval` no long creates a new local variable scope, but affects variables in the scope it is called from (#4443). `source` still creates a new local scope.\r\n- `abbr` has a new `--query` option to check for the existence of an abbreviation.\r\n- Local values for `fish_complete_path` and `fish_function_path` are now ignored; only their global values are respected.\r\n- Syntax error reports now display a marker in the correct position (#5812).\r\n- Empty universal variables may now be exported (#5992).\r\n- Exported universal variables are no longer imported into the global scope, preventing shadowing. This makes it easier to change such variables for all fish sessions and avoids breakage when the value is a list of multiple elements (#5258).\r\n- A bug where `for` could use invalid variable names has been fixed (#5800).\r\n- A bug where local variables would not be exported to functions has been fixed (#6153).\r\n- The null command (`:`) now always exits successfully, rather than passing through the previous exit status (#6022).\r\n- The output of `functions FUNCTION` matches the declaration of the function, correctly including comments or blank lines (#5285), and correctly includes any `--wraps` flags (#1625).\r\n- `type` supports a new option, `--short`, which suppress function expansion (#6403).\r\n- `type --path` with a function argument will now output the path to the file containing the definition of that function, if it exists.\r\n- `type --force-path` with an argument that cannot be found now correctly outputs nothing, as documented (#6411).\r\n- The `$hostname` variable is no longer truncated to 32 characters (#5758).\r\n- Line numbers in function backtraces are calculated correctly (#6350).\r\n- A new `fish_cancel` event is emitted when the command line is cancelled, which is useful for terminal integration (#5973).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n- New Base16 color options are available through the Web-based configuration (#6504).\r\n- fish only parses `/etc/paths` on macOS in login shells, matching the bash implementation (#5637) and avoiding changes to path ordering in child shells (#5456). It now ignores blank lines like the bash implementation (#5809).\r\n- The locale is now reloaded when the `LOCPATH` variable is changed (#5815).\r\n- `read` no longer keeps a history, making it suitable for operations that shouldn't end up there, like password entry (#5904).\r\n- `dirh` outputs its stack in the correct order (#5477), and behaves as documented when universal variables are used for its stack (#5797).\r\n- `funced` and the edit-commandline-in-buffer bindings did not work in fish 3.0 when the `$EDITOR` variable contained spaces; this has been corrected (#5625).\r\n- Builtins now pipe their help output to a pager automatically (#6227).\r\n- `set_color` now colors the `--print-colors` output in the matching colors if it is going to a terminal.\r\n- fish now underlines every valid entered path instead of just the last one (#5872).\r\n- When syntax highlighting a string with an unclosed quote, only the quote itself will be shown as an error, instead of the whole argument.\r\n- Syntax highlighting works correctly with variables as commands (#5658) and redirections to close file descriptors (#6092).\r\n- `help` works properly on Windows Subsytem for Linux (#5759, #6338).\r\n- A bug where `disown` could crash the shell has been fixed (#5720).\r\n- fish will not autosuggest files ending with `~` unless there are no other candidates, as these are generally backup files (#985).\r\n- Escape in the pager works correctly (#5818).\r\n- Key bindings that call `fg` no longer leave the terminal in a broken state (#2114).\r\n- Brackets (#5831) and filenames containing `$` (#6060) are completed with appropriate escaping.\r\n- The output of `complete` and `functions` is now colorized in interactive terminals.\r\n- The Web-based configuration handles aliases that include single quotes correctly (#6120), and launches correctly under Termux (#6248) and OpenBSD (#6522).\r\n- `function` now correctly validates parameters for `--argument-names` as valid variable names (#6147) and correctly parses options following `--argument-names`, as in \"`--argument-names foo --description bar`\" (#6186).\r\n- History newly imported from bash includes command lines using `&&` or `||`.\r\n- The automatic generation of completions from manual pages is better described in job and process listings, and no longer produces a warning when exiting fish (#6269).\r\n- In private mode, setting `$fish_greeting` to an empty string before starting the private session will prevent the warning about history not being saved from being printed (#6299).\r\n- In the interactive editor, a line break (Enter) inside unclosed brackets will insert a new line, rather than executing the command and producing an error (#6316).\r\n- Ctrl-C always repaints the prompt (#6394).\r\n- When run interactively from another program (such as Python), fish will correctly start a new process group, like other shells (#5909).\r\n- Job identifiers (for example, for background jobs) are assigned more logically (#6053).\r\n- A bug where history would appear truncated if an empty command was executed was fixed (#6032).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n- Pasting strips leading spaces to avoid pasted commands being omitted from the history (#4327).\r\n- Shift-Left and Shift-Right now default to moving backwards and forwards by one bigword (words separated by whitespace) (#1505).\r\n- The default escape delay (to differentiate between the escape key and an alt-combination) has been reduced to 30ms, down from 300ms for the default mode and 100ms for Vi mode (#3904).\r\n- The `forward-bigword` binding now interacts correctly with autosuggestions (#5336).\r\n- The `fish_clipboard_*` functions support Wayland by using [`wl-clipboard`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) (#5450).\r\n- The `nextd` and `prevd` functions no longer print \"Hit end of history\", instead using a bell. They correctly store working directories containing symbolic links (#6395).\r\n- If a `fish_mode_prompt` function exists, Vi mode will only execute it on mode-switch instead of the entire prompt. This should make it much more responsive with slow prompts (#5783).\r\n- The path-component bindings (like Ctrl-w) now also stop at \":\" and \"@\", because those are used to denote user and host in commands such as `ssh` (#5841).\r\n- The NULL character can now be bound via `bind -k nul`. Terminals often generate this character via control-space. (#3189).\r\n- A new readline command `expand-abbr` can be used to trigger abbreviation expansion (#5762).\r\n- A new readline command, `delete-or-exit`, removes a character to the right of the cursor or exits the shell if the command line is empty (moving this functionality out of the `delete-or-exit` function).\r\n- The `self-insert` readline command will now insert the binding sequence, if not empty.\r\n- A new binding to prepend `sudo`, bound to Alt-S by default (#6140).\r\n- The Alt-W binding to describe a command should now work better with multiline prompts (#6110)\r\n- The Alt-H binding to open a command's man page now tries to ignore `sudo` (#6122).\r\n- A new pair of bind functions, `history-prefix-search-backward` (and `forward`), was introduced (#6143).\r\n- Vi mode now supports R to enter replace mode (#6342), and `d0` to delete the current line (#6292).\r\n- In Vi mode, hitting Enter in replace-one mode no longer erases the prompt (#6298).\r\n- Selections in Vi mode are inclusive, matching the actual behaviour of Vi (#5770).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n- The Git prompt in informative mode now shows the number of stashes if enabled.\r\n- The Git prompt now has an option (`$__fish_git_prompt_use_informative_chars`) to use the (more modern) informative characters without enabling informative mode.\r\n- The default prompt now also features VCS integration and will color the host if running via SSH (#6375).\r\n- The default and example prompts print the pipe status if an earlier command in the pipe fails.\r\n- The default and example prompts try to resolve exit statuses to signal names when appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal output\r\n- New `fish_pager_color_` options have been added to control more elements of the pager's colors (#5524).\r\n- Better detection and support for using fish from various system consoles, where limited colors and special characters are supported (#5552).\r\n- fish now tries to guess if the system supports Unicode 9 (and displays emoji as wide), eliminating the need to set `$fish_emoji_width` in most cases (#5722).\r\n- Improvements to the display of wide characters, particularly Korean characters and emoji (#5583, #5729).\r\n- The Vi mode cursor is correctly redrawn when regaining focus under terminals that report focus (eg tmux) (#4788).\r\n- Variables that control background colors (such as `fish_pager_color_search_match`) can now use `--reverse`.\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `aws`\r\n  - `bat` (#6052)\r\n  - `bosh` (#5700)\r\n  - `btrfs`\r\n  - `camcontrol`\r\n  - `cf` (#5700)\r\n  - `chronyc` (#6496)\r\n  - `code` (#6205)\r\n  - `cryptsetup` (#6488)\r\n  - `csc` and `csi` (#6016)\r\n  - `cwebp` (#6034)\r\n  - `cygpath` and `cygstart` (#6239)\r\n  - `epkginfo` (#5829)\r\n  - `ffmpeg`, `ffplay`, and `ffprobe` (#5922)\r\n  - `fsharpc` and `fsharpi` (#6016)\r\n  - `fzf` (#6178)\r\n  - `g++` (#6217)\r\n  - `gpg1` (#6139)\r\n  - `gpg2` (#6062)\r\n  - `grub-mkrescue` (#6182)\r\n  - `hledger` (#6043)\r\n  - `hwinfo` (#6496)\r\n  - `irb` (#6260)\r\n  - `iw` (#6232)\r\n  - `kak`\r\n  - `keepassxc-cli` (#6505)\r\n  - `keybase` (#6410)\r\n  - `loginctl` (#6501)\r\n  - `lz4`, `lz4c` and `lz4cat` (#6364)\r\n  - `mariner` (#5718)\r\n  - `nethack` (#6240)\r\n  - `patool` (#6083)\r\n  - `phpunit` (#6197)\r\n  - `plutil` (#6301)\r\n  - `pzstd` (#6364)\r\n  - `qubes-gpg-client` (#6067)\r\n  - `resolvectl` (#6501)\r\n  - `rg`\r\n  - `rustup`\r\n  - `sfdx` (#6149)\r\n  - `speedtest` and `speedtest-cli` (#5840)\r\n  - `src` (#6026)\r\n  - `tokei` (#6085)\r\n  - `tsc` (#6016)\r\n  - `unlz4` (#6364)\r\n  - `unzstd` (#6364)\r\n  - `vbc` (#6016)\r\n  - `zpaq` (#6245)\r\n  - `zstd`, `zstdcat`, `zstdgrep`, `zstdless` and `zstdmt` (#6364)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions.\r\n- Selecting short options which also have a long name from the completion pager is possible (#5634).\r\n- Tab completion will no longer add trailing spaces if they already exist (#6107).\r\n- Completion of subcommands to builtins like `and` or `not` now works correctly (#6249).\r\n- Completion of arguments to short options works correctly when multiple short options are used together (#332).\r\n- Activating completion in the middle of an invalid completion does not move the cursor any more, making it easier to fix a mistake (#4124).\r\n- Completion in empty commandlines now lists all available commands.\r\n- Functions listed as completions could previously leak parts of the function as other completions; this has been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n- The vcs-prompt functions have been promoted to names without double-underscore, so __fish_git_prompt is now fish_git_prompt, __fish_vcs_prompt is now fish_vcs_prompt, __fish_hg_prompt is now fish_hg_prompt and __fish_svn_prompt is now fish_svn_prompt. Shims at the old names have been added, and the variables have kept their old names (#5586).\r\n- `string replace` has an additional round of escaping in the replacement expression, so escaping backslashes requires many escapes (eg `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$1' a`). The new feature flag `regex-easyesc` can be used to disable this, so that the same effect can be achieved with `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\$1' a` (#5556). As a reminder, the intention behind feature flags is that this will eventually become the default and then only option, so scripts should be updated.\r\n- The `fish_vi_mode` function, deprecated in fish 2.3, has been removed. Use `fish_vi_key_bindings` instead (#6372).\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n- fish 3.0 introduced a CMake-based build system. In fish 3.1, both the Autotools-based build and legacy Xcode build system have been removed, leaving only the CMake build system. All distributors and developers must install CMake.\r\n- fish now depends on the common `tee` external command, for the `psub` process substitution function.\r\n- The documentation is now built with Sphinx. The old Doxygen-based documentation system has been removed. Developers, and distributors who wish to rebuild the documentation, must install Sphinx.\r\n- The `INTERNAL_WCWIDTH` build option has been removed, as fish now always uses an internal `wcwidth` function. It has a number of configuration options that make it more suitable for general use (#5777).\r\n- mandoc can now be used to format the output from `--help` if `nroff` is not installed, reducing the number of external dependencies on systems with `mandoc` installed (#5489).\r\n- Some bugs preventing building on Solaris-derived systems such as Illumos were fixed (#5458, #5461, #5611).\r\n- Completions for `npm`, `bower` and `yarn` no longer require the `jq` utility for full functionality, but will use Python instead if it is available.\r\n- The paths for completions, functions and configuration snippets have been extended. On systems that define `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, each of the directories in this variable are searched in the subdirectories `fish/vendor_completions.d`, `fish/vendor_functions.d`, and `fish/vendor_conf.d` respectively. On systems that do not define this variable in the environment, the vendor directories are searched for in both the installation prefix and the default \"extra\" directory, which now defaults to `/usr/local` (#5029).",

The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is 21677a5755ee1738bad2cf8179c104068f8bb81b969660d5a2af4ba6eceba5e4. A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"fish-3.0.1.tar.gz.asc\".*\r\n\r\n### Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n- `exec` does not complain about running foreground jobs when called (#5449).\r\n- while loops now evaluate to the last executed command in the loop body (or zero if the body was empty), matching POSIX semantics (#4982).\r\n- `read --silent` no longer echoes to the tty when run from a non-interactive script (#5519).\r\n- On macOS, path entries with spaces in `/etc/paths` and `/etc/paths.d` now correctly set path entries with spaces. Likewise, `MANPATH` is correctly set from `/etc/manpaths` and `/etc/manpaths.d` (#5481).\r\n- fish starts correctly under Cygwin/MSYS2 (#5426).\r\n- The `pager-toggle-search` binding (Ctrl-S by default) will now activate the search field, even when the pager is not focused.\r\n- The error when a command is not found is now printed a single time, instead of once per argument (#5588).\r\n- Fixes and improvements to the git completions, including printing correct paths with older git versions, fuzzy matching again, reducing unnecessary offers of root paths (starting with `:/`) (#5578, #5574, #5476), and ignoring shell aliases, so enterprising users can set up the wrapping command (via `set -g __fish_git_alias_$command $whatitwraps`) (#5412).\r\n- Significant performance improvements to core shell functions (#5447) and to the `kill` completions (#5541). \r\n- Starting in symbolically-linked working directories works correctly (#5525).\r\n- The default `fish_title` function no longer contains extra spaces (#5517).\r\n- The `nim` prompt now works correctly when chosen in the Web-based configuration (#5490).\r\n- `string` now prints help to stdout, like other builtins (#5495).\r\n- Killing the terminal while fish is in vi normal mode will no longer send it spinning and eating CPU.

        "body": "fish 3 is a major release, which introduces some breaking changes alongside improved functionality. Although most existing scripts will continue to work, they should be reviewed against the list contained below.\r\n\r\n_Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.0.0.tar.gz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" may not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is ea9dd3614bb0346829ce7319437c6a93e3e1dfde3b7f6a469b543b0d2c68f2cf. A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"fish-3.0.0.tar.gz.asc\"._\r\n\r\nCompared to the beta release of fish 3.0b1, fish version 3.0.0:\r\n\r\n- builds correctly against musl libc (#5407)\r\n- handles huge numeric arguments to `test` correctly (#5414)\r\n- removes the history colouring introduced in 3.0b1, which did not always work correctly\r\n\r\nThere is one significant known issue which was not able to be corrected before the release:\r\n\r\n- fish 3.0.0 builds on Cygwin (#5423), but does not run correctly (#5426) and will result in a hanging terminal when started. Cygwin users are encouraged to continue using 2.7.1 until a release which corrects this is available.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 2.7.1 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.0b1, which follow.\r\n\r\n## Notable non-backward compatible changes\r\n-  Process and job expansion has largely been removed. `%` will no longer perform these expansions, except for `%self` for the PID of the current shell. Additionally, job management commands (`disown`, `wait`, `bg`, `fg` and `kill`) will expand job specifiers starting with `%` (#4230, #1202).\r\n- `set x[1] x[2] a b`, to set multiple elements of an array at once, is no longer valid syntax (#4236).\r\n- A literal `{}` now expands to itself, rather than nothing. This makes working with `find -exec` easier (#1109, #4632).\r\n- Literally accessing a zero-index is now illegal syntax and is caught by the parser (#4862). (fish indices start at 1)\r\n- Successive commas in brace expansions are handled in less surprising manner. For example, `{,,,}` expands to four empty strings rather than an empty string, a comma and an empty string again (#3002, #4632).\r\n- `for` loop control variables are no longer local to the `for` block (#1935).\r\n- Variables set in `if` and `while` conditions are available outside the block (#4820).\r\n- Local exported (`set -lx`) vars are now visible to functions (#1091).\r\n- The new `math` builtin (see below) does not support logical expressions; `test` should be used instead (#4777).\r\n- Range expansion will now behave sensibly when given a single positive and negative index (`$foo[5..-1]` or `$foo[-1..5]`), clamping to the last valid index without changing direction if the list has fewer elements than expected.\r\n- `read` now uses `-s` as short for `--silent` (\u00e0 la `bash`); `--shell`'s abbreviation (formerly `-s`) is now `-S` instead (#4490).\r\n- `cd` no longer resolves symlinks. fish now maintains a virtual path, matching other shells (#3350).\r\n- `source` now requires an explicit `-` as the filename to read from the terminal (#2633).\r\n- Arguments to `end` are now errors, instead of being silently ignored.\r\n- The names `argparse`, `read`, `set`, `status`, `test` and `[` are now reserved and not allowed as function names. This prevents users unintentionally breaking stuff (#3000).\r\n- The `fish_user_abbreviations` variable is no longer used; abbreviations will be migrated to the new storage format automatically.\r\n- The `FISH_READ_BYTE_LIMIT` variable is now called `fish_byte_limit` (#4414).\r\n- Environment variables are no longer split into arrays based on the record separator character on startup. Instead, variables are not split, unless their name ends in PATH, in which case they are split on colons (#436).\r\n- The `history` builtin's `--with-time` option has been removed; this has been deprecated in favor of `--show-time` since 2.7.0 (#4403).\r\n- The internal variables `__fish_datadir` and `__fish_sysconfdir` are now known as `__fish_data_dir` and `__fish_sysconf_dir` respectively.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nWith the release of fish 3, a number of features have been marked for removal in the future. All users are encouraged to explore alternatives. A small number of these features are currently behind feature flags, which are turned on at present but may be turned off by default in the future.\r\n\r\nA new feature flags mechanism is added for staging deprecations and breaking changes. Feature flags may be specified at launch with `fish --features ...` or by setting the universal `fish_features` variable. (#4940)\r\n\r\n- The use of the `IFS` variable for `read` is deprecated; `IFS` will be ignored in the future (#4156). Use the `read --delimiter` option instead.\r\n- The `function --on-process-exit` switch will be removed in future (#4700). Use the `fish_exit` event instead: `function --on-event fish_exit`.\r\n- `$_` is deprecated and will removed in the future (#813). Use `status current-command` in a command substitution instead.\r\n- `^` as a redirection deprecated and will be removed in the future. (#4394). Use `2>` to redirect stderr. This is controlled by the `stderr-nocaret` feature flag.\r\n- `?` as a glob (wildcard) is deprecated and will be removed in the future (#4520). This is controlled by the `qmark-noglob` feature flag.\r\n\r\n## Notable fixes and improvements\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n- fish now supports `&&` (like `and`), `||` (like `or`), and `!` (like `not`), for better migration from POSIX-compliant shells (#4620).\r\n- Variables may be used as commands (#154).\r\n- fish may be started in private mode via `fish --private`. Private mode fish sessions do not have access to the history file and any commands evaluated in private mode are not persisted for future sessions. A session variable `$fish_private_mode` can be queried to detect private mode and adjust the behavior of scripts accordingly to respect the user's wish for privacy.\r\n- A new `wait` command for waiting on backgrounded processes (#4498).\r\n- `math` is now a builtin rather than a wrapper around `bc` (#3157). Floating point computations is now used by default, and can be controlled with the new `--scale` option (#4478).\r\n- Setting `$PATH` no longer warns on non-existent directories, allowing for a single $PATH to be shared across machines (eg via dotfiles) (#2969).\r\n- `while` sets `$status` to a non-zero value if the loop is not executed (#4982).\r\n- Command substitution output is now limited to 10 MB by default, controlled by the `fish_read_limit` variable (#3822). Notably, this is larger than most operating systems' argument size limit, so trying to pass argument lists this size to external commands has never worked.\r\n- The machine hostname, where available, is now exposed as the `$hostname` reserved variable. This removes the dependency on the `hostname` executable (#4422).\r\n- Bare `bind` invocations in config.fish now work. The `fish_user_key_bindings` function is no longer necessary, but will still be executed if it exists (#5191).\r\n- `$fish_pid` and `$last_pid` are available as replacements for `%self` and `%last`.\r\n\r\n### New features in commands\r\n- `alias` has a new `--save` option to save the generated function immediately (#4878).\r\n- `bind` has a new `--silent` option to ignore bind requests for named keys not available under the current terminal (#4188, #4431).\r\n- `complete` has a new `--keep-order` option to show the provided or dynamically-generated argument list in the same order as specified, rather than alphabetically (#361).\r\n- `exec` prompts for confirmation if background jobs are running.\r\n- `funced` has a new `--save` option to automatically save the edited function after successfully editing (#4668).\r\n- `functions` has a new ` --handlers` option to show functions registered as event handlers (#4694).\r\n- `history search` supports globs for wildcard searching (#3136) and has a new `--reverse` option to show entries from oldest to newest (#4375).\r\n- `jobs` has a new `--quiet` option to silence the output.\r\n- `read` has a new `--delimiter` option for splitting input into arrays (#4256).\r\n- `read` writes directly to stdout if called without arguments (#4407).\r\n- `read` can now read individual lines into separate variables without consuming the input in its entirety via the new `/--line` option.\r\n- `set` has new `--append` and `--prepend` options (#1326).\r\n- `set` has a new `--show` option to show lots of information about variables (#4265).\r\n- `string match` with an empty pattern and `--entire` in glob mode now matches everything instead of nothing (#4971).\r\n- `string split` supports a new `--no-empty` option to exclude empty strings from the result (#4779).\r\n- `string` has new subcommands `split0` and `join0` for working with NUL-delimited output.\r\n- `string` no longer stops processing text after NUL characters (#4605)\r\n- `string escape` has a new `--style regex` option for escaping strings to be matched literally in `string` regex operations.\r\n- `test` now supports floating point values in numeric comparisons.\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n- A pipe at the end of a line now allows the job to continue on the next line (#1285).\r\n- Italics and dim support out of the box on macOS for Terminal.app and iTerm (#4436).\r\n- `cd` tab completions no longer descend into the deepest unambiguous path (#4649).\r\n- Pager navigation has been improved. Most notably, moving down now wraps around, moving up from the commandline now jumps to the last element and moving right and left now reverse each other even when wrapping around (#4680).\r\n- Typing normal characters while the completion pager is active no longer shows the search field. Instead it enters them into the command line, and ends paging (#2249).\r\n- A new input binding `pager-toggle-search` toggles the search field in the completions pager on and off. By default, this is bound to Ctrl-S.\r\n- Searching in the pager now does a full fuzzy search (#5213).\r\n- The pager will now show the full command instead of just its last line if the number of completions is large (#4702).\r\n- Abbreviations can be tab-completed (#3233).\r\n- Tildes in file names are now properly escaped in completions (#2274).\r\n- Wrapping completions (from `complete --wraps` or `function --wraps`) can now inject arguments. For example, `complete gco --wraps 'git checkout'` now works properly (#1976). The `alias` function has been updated to respect this behavior.\r\n- Path completions now support expansions, meaning expressions like `python ~/<TAB>` now provides file suggestions just like any other relative or absolute path. (This includes support for other expansions, too.)\r\n- Autosuggestions try to avoid arguments that are already present in the command line.\r\n- Notifications about crashed processes are now always shown, even in command substitutions (#4962).\r\n- The screen is no longer reset after a BEL, fixing graphical glitches (#3693).\r\n- vi-mode now supports ';' and ',' motions. This introduces new {forward,backward}-jump-till and repeat-jump{,-reverse} bind functions (#5140).\r\n- The `*y` vi-mode binding now works (#5100).\r\n- True color is now enabled in neovim by default (#2792).\r\n- Terminal size variables (`$COLUMNS`/`$LINES`) are now updated before `fish_prompt` is called, allowing the prompt to react (#904).\r\n- Multi-line prompts no longer repeat when the terminal is resized (#2320).\r\n- `xclip` support has been added to the clipboard integration (#5020).\r\n- The Alt-P keybinding paginates the last command if the command line is empty.\r\n- `$cmd_duration` is no longer reset when no command is executed (#5011).\r\n- Deleting a one-character word no longer erases the next word as well (#4747).\r\n- Token history search (Alt-Up) omits duplicate entries (#4795).\r\n- The `fish_escape_delay_ms` timeout, allowing the use of the escape key both on its own and as part of a control sequence, was applied to all control characters; this has been reduced to just the escape key.\r\n- Completing a function shows the description properly (#5206).\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `ansible`, including `ansible-galaxy`, `ansible-playbook` and `ansible-vault` (#4697)\r\n  - `bb-power` (#4800)\r\n  - `bd` (#4472)\r\n  - `bower`\r\n  - `clang` and `clang++` (#4174)\r\n  - `conda` (#4837)\r\n  - `configure` (for autoconf-generated files only)\r\n  - `curl`\r\n  - `doas` (#5196)\r\n  - `ebuild` (#4911)\r\n  - `emaint` (#4758)\r\n  - `eopkg` (#4600)\r\n  - `exercism` (#4495)\r\n  - `hjson`\r\n  - `hugo` (#4529)\r\n  - `j` (from autojump #4344)\r\n  - `jbake` (#4814)\r\n  - `jhipster` (#4472)\r\n  - `kitty`\r\n  - `kldload`\r\n  - `kldunload`\r\n  - `makensis` (#5242)\r\n  - `meson`\r\n  - `mkdocs` (#4906)\r\n  - `ngrok` (#4642)\r\n  - OpenBSD's `pkg_add`, `pkg_delete`, `pkg_info`, `pfctl`, `rcctl`, `signify`, and `vmctl` (#4584)\r\n  - `openocd`\r\n  - `optipng`\r\n  - `opkg` (#5168)\r\n  - `pandoc` (#2937)\r\n  - `port` (#4737)\r\n  - `powerpill` (#4800)\r\n  - `pstack` (#5135)\r\n  - `serve` (#5026)\r\n  - `ttx`\r\n  - `unzip`\r\n  - `virsh` (#5113)\r\n  - `xclip` (#5126)\r\n  - `xsv`\r\n  - `zfs` and `zpool` (#4608)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions (especially `darcs` (#5112), `git`, `hg` and `sudo`).\r\n- Completions for `yarn` and `npm` now require the `all-the-package-names` NPM package for full functionality.\r\n- Completions for `bower` and `yarn` now require the `jq` utility for full functionality.\r\n- Improved French translations.\r\n\r\n### Other fixes and improvements\r\n- Significant performance improvements to `abbr` (#4048), setting variables (#4200, #4341), executing functions, globs (#4579), `string` reading from standard input (#4610), and slicing history (in particular, `$history[1]` for the last executed command).\r\n- Fish's internal wcwidth function has been updated to deal with newer Unicode, and the width of some characters can be configured via the `fish_ambiguous_width` (#5149) and `fish_emoji_width` (#2652) variables. Alternatively, a new build-time option INTERNAL_WCWIDTH can be used to use the system's wcwidth instead (#4816).\r\n- `functions` correctly supports `-d` as the short form of `--description`. (#5105)\r\n- `/etc/paths` is now parsed like macOS' bash `path_helper`, fixing $PATH order (#4336, #4852) on macOS.\r\n- Using a read-only variable in a `for` loop produces an error, rather than silently producing incorrect results (#4342).\r\n- The universal variables filename no longer contains the hostname or MAC address. It is now at the fixed location `.config/fish/fish_variables` (#1912).\r\n- Exported variables in the global or universal scope no longer have their exported status affected by local variables (#2611).\r\n- Major rework of terminal and job handling to eliminate bugs (#3805, #3952, #4178, #4235, #4238, #4540, #4929, #5210).\r\n- Improvements to the manual page completion generator (#2937, #4313).\r\n- `suspend --force` now works correctly (#4672).\r\n- Pressing Ctrl-C while running a script now reliably terminates fish (#5253).\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n- fish ships with a new build system based on CMake. CMake 3.2 is the minimum required version. Although the autotools-based Makefile and the Xcode project are still shipped with this release, they will be removed in the near future. All distributors and developers are encouraged to migrate to the CMake build.\r\n- Build scripts for most platforms no longer require bash, using the standard sh instead.\r\n- The `hostname` command is no longer required for fish to operate.\r\n",

This also includes the `fish_opt` helper command. (#4190).\r\n- Invalid array indexes are now silently ignored (#826, #4127).\r\n- Improvements to the debugging facility, including a prompt specific to the debugger (`fish_breakpoint_prompt`) and a `status is-breakpoint` subcommand (#1310).\r\n- `string` supports new `lower` and `upper` subcommands, for altering the case of strings (#4080). The case changing is not locale-aware yet.\r\n- `string escape` has a new `--style=xxx` flag where `xxx` can be `script`, `var`, or `url` (#4150), and can be reversed with `string unescape` (#3543).\r\n- History can now be split into sessions with the `fish_history` variable, or not saved to disk at all (#102).\r\n- Read history is now controlled by the `fish_history` variable rather than the `--mode-name` flag (#1504).\r\n- `command` now supports an `--all` flag to report all directories with the command. `which` is no longer a runtime dependency (#2778).\r\n- fish can run commands before starting an interactive session using the new `--init-command`/`-C` options (#4164).\r\n- `set` has a new `--show` option to show lots of information about variables (#4265).\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n- The `COLUMNS` and `LINES` environment variables are now correctly set the first time `fish_prompt` is run (#4141).\r\n- `complete`'s `--no-files` option works as intended (#112).\r\n- `echo -h` now correctly echoes `-h` in line with other shells (#4120).\r\n- The `export` compatibility function now returns zero on success, rather than always returning 1 (#4435).\r\n- Stop converting empty elements in MANPATH to \".\" (#4158). The behavior being changed was introduced in fish 2.6.0.\r\n- `count -h` and `count --help` now return 1 rather than produce command help output (#4189).\r\n- An attempt to `read` which stops because too much data is available still defines the variables given as parameters (#4180).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.4.0 which prevented `pushd +1` from working has been fixed (#4091).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.6.0 where multiple `read` commands in non-interactive scripts were broken has been fixed (#4206).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.6.0 involving universal variables with side-effects at startup such as `set -U fish_escape_delay_ms 10` has been fixed (#4196).\r\n- Added completions for:\r\n  - `as` (#4130)\r\n  - `cdh` (#2847)\r\n  - `dhcpd` (#4115)\r\n  - `ezjail-admin` (#4324)\r\n  - Fabric's `fab` (#4153)\r\n  - `grub-file` (#4119)\r\n  - `grub-install` (#4119)\r\n  - `jest` (#4142)\r\n  - `kdeconnect-cli`\r\n  - `magneto` (#4043, #4108)\r\n  - `mdadm` (#4198)\r\n  - `passwd` (#4209)\r\n  - `pip` and `pipenv` (#4448)\r\n  - `s3cmd` (#4332)\r\n  - `sbt` (#4347)\r\n  - `snap` (#4215)\r\n  - Sublime Text 3's `subl` (#4277)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions.\r\n- Updated Chinese and French translations.",

        "body": "\r\nThere are no major changes between 2.7b1 and 2.7.0. If you are upgrading from version 2.6.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 2.7b1 (included below).\r\n\r\nXcode builds and macOS packages could not be produced with 2.7b1, but this is fixed in 2.7.0.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe release notes for fish 2.7b1 are as follows:\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements\r\n- A new `cdh` (change directory using recent history) command provides a more friendly alternative to prevd/nextd and pushd/popd (#2847).\r\n- A new `argparse` command is available to allow fish script to parse arguments with the same behavior as builtin commands. This also includes the `fish_opt` helper command. (#4190).\r\n- Invalid array indexes are now silently ignored (#826, #4127).\r\n- Improvements to the debugging facility, including a prompt specific to the debugger (`fish_breakpoint_prompt`) and a `status is-breakpoint` subcommand (#1310).\r\n- `string` supports new `lower` and `upper` subcommands, for altering the case of strings (#4080). The case changing is not locale-aware yet.\r\n- `string escape` has a new `--style=xxx` flag where `xxx` can be `script`, `var`, or `url` (#4150), and can be reversed with `string unescape` (#3543).\r\n- History can now be split into sessions with the `fish_history` variable, or not saved to disk at all (#102).\r\n- Read history is now controlled by the `fish_history` variable rather than the `--mode-name` flag (#1504).\r\n- `command` now supports an `--all` flag to report all directories with the command. `which` is no longer a runtime dependency (#2778).\r\n- fish can run commands before starting an interactive session using the new `--init-command`/`-C` options (#4164).\r\n- `set` has a new `--show` option to show lots of information about variables (#4265).\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n- The `COLUMNS` and `LINES` environment variables are now correctly set the first time `fish_prompt` is run (#4141).\r\n- `complete`'s `--no-files` option works as intended (#112).\r\n- `echo -h` now correctly echoes `-h` in line with other shells (#4120).\r\n- The `export` compatibility function now returns zero on success, rather than always returning 1 (#4435).\r\n- Stop converting empty elements in MANPATH to \".\" (#4158). The behavior being changed was introduced in fish 2.6.0.\r\n- `count -h` and `count --help` now return 1 rather than produce command help output (#4189).\r\n- An attempt to `read` which stops because too much data is available still defines the variables given as parameters (#4180).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.4.0 which prevented `pushd +1` from working has been fixed (#4091).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.6.0 where multiple `read` commands in non-interactive scripts were broken has been fixed (#4206).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.6.0 involving universal variables with side-effects at startup such as `set -U fish_escape_delay_ms 10` has been fixed (#4196).\r\n- Added completions for:\r\n  - `as` (#4130)\r\n  - `cdh` (#2847)\r\n  - `dhcpd` (#4115)\r\n  - `ezjail-admin` (#4324)\r\n  - Fabric's `fab` (#4153)\r\n  - `grub-file` (#4119)\r\n  - `grub-install` (#4119)\r\n  - `jest` (#4142)\r\n  - `kdeconnect-cli`\r\n  - `magneto` (#4043, #4108)\r\n  - `mdadm` (#4198)\r\n  - `passwd` (#4209)\r\n  - `pip` and `pipenv` (#4448)\r\n  - `s3cmd` (#4332)\r\n  - `sbt` (#4347)\r\n  - `snap` (#4215)\r\n  - Sublime Text 3's `subl` (#4277)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions.\r\n- Updated Chinese and French translations.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDownload links:\r\nTo download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-2.7.0.tar.gz\".

        "body": "Since the beta release of fish 2.6b1, fish version 2.6.0 contains a number of minor fixes, new completions for `magneto` (#4043), and improvements to the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\n- Apple macOS Sierra 10.12.5 introduced a problem with launching web browsers from other programs using AppleScript. This affects the fish Web configuration (`fish_config`); users on these platforms will need to manually open the address displayed in the terminal, such as by copying and pasting it into a browser. This problem will be fixed with macOS 10.12.6.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 2.5.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 2.6b1 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe release notes for fish 2.6b1 are as follows:\r\n\r\n## Notable fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n- Jobs running in the background can now be removed from the list of jobs with the new `disown` builtin, which behaves like the same command in other shells (#2810).\r\n- Command substitutions now have access to the terminal, like in other shells. This allows tools like `fzf` to work properly (#1362, #3922).\r\n- In cases where the operating system does not report the size of the terminal, the `COLUMNS` and `LINES` environment variables are used; if they are unset, a default of 80x24 is assumed.\r\n- New French (#3772 & #3788) and improved German (#3834) translations.\r\n- fish no longer depends on the `which` external command.\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n\r\n- Performance improvements in launching processes, including major reductions in signal blocking. Although this has been heavily tested, it may cause problems in some circumstances; set the `FISH_NO_SIGNAL_BLOCK` variable to 0 in your fish configuration file to return to the old behaviour (#2007).\r\n- Performance improvements in prompts and functions that set lots of colours (#3793).\r\n- The Delete key no longer deletes backwards (a regression in 2.5.0).\r\n- `functions` supports a new `--details` option, which identifies where the function was loaded from (#3295), and a `--details --verbose` option which includes the function description (#597).\r\n- `read` will read up to 10 MiB by default, leaving the target variable empty and exiting with status 122 if the line is too long. You can set a different limit with the `FISH_READ_BYTE_LIMIT` variable.\r\n- `read` supports a new `--silent` option to hide the characters typed (#838), for when reading sensitive data from the terminal. `read` also now accepts simple strings for the prompt (rather than scripts) with the new `-P` and `--prompt-str` options (#802).\r\n- `export` and `setenv` now understand colon-separated `PATH`, `CDPATH` and `MANPATH` variables.\r\n- `bind` supports a new `--list-modes` option (#3872).\r\n- `bg` will check all of its arguments before backgrounding any jobs; any invalid arguments will cause a failure, but non-existent (eg recently exited) jobs are ignored (#3909).\r\n- `funced` warns if the function being edited has not been modified (#3961).\r\n- `printf` correctly outputs \"long long\" integers (#3352).\r\n- `status` supports a new `current-function` subcommand to print the current function name (#1743).\r\n- `string` supports a new `repeat` subcommand (#3864). `string match` supports a new `--entire` option to emit the entire line matched by a pattern (#3957). `string replace` supports a new `--filter` option to only emit lines which underwent a replacement (#3348).\r\n- `test` supports the `-k` option to test for sticky bits (#733).\r\n- `umask` understands symbolic modes (#738). \r\n- Empty components in the `CDPATH`, `MANPATH` and `PATH` variables are now converted to \".\" (#2106, #3914).\r\n- New versions of ncurses (6.0 and up) wipe terminal scrollback buffers with certain commands; the `C-l` binding tries to avoid this (#2855).\r\n- Some systems' `su` implementations do not set the `USER` environment variable; it is now reset for root users (#3916).\r\n- Under terminals which support it, bracketed paste is enabled, escaping problematic characters for security and convience (#3871). Inside single quotes (`'`), single quotes and backslashes in pasted text are escaped (#967). The `fish_clipboard_paste` function (bound to `C-v` by default) is still the recommended pasting method where possible as it includes this functionality and more.\r\n- Processes in pipelines are no longer signalled as soon as one command in the pipeline has completed (#1926). This behaviour matches other shells mre closely.\r\n- All functions requiring Python work with whichever version of Python is installed (#3970). Python 3 is preferred, but Python 2.6 remains the minimum version required.\r\n- The color of the cancellation character can be controlled by the `fish_color_cancel` variable (#3963).\r\n- Added completions for:\r\n - `caddy` (#4008)\r\n - `castnow` (#3744)\r\n - `climate` (#3760)\r\n - `flatpak`\r\n - `gradle` (#3859)\r\n - `gsettings` (#4001)\r\n - `helm` (#3829)\r\n - `i3-msg` (#3787)\r\n - `ipset` (#3924)\r\n - `jq` (#3804)\r\n - `light` (#3752)\r\n - `minikube` (#3778)\r\n - `mocha` (#3828)\r\n - `mkdosfs` (#4017)\r\n - `pv` (#3773)\r\n - `setsid` (#3791)\r\n - `terraform` (#3960)\r\n - `usermod` (#3775)\r\n - `xinput`\r\n - `yarn` (#3816)\r\n- Improved completions for `adb` (#3853), `apt` (#3771), `bzr` (#3769), `dconf`, `git` (including #3743), `grep` (#3789), `go` (#3789), `help` (#3789), `hg` (#3975), `htop` (#3789), `killall` (#3996), `lua`, `man` (#3762), `mount` (#3764 & #3841), `obnam` (#3924), `perl` (#3856), `portmaster` (#3950), `python` (#3840), `ssh` (#3781), `scp` (#3781), `systemctl` (#3757) and `udisks` (#3764).\r\n\r\nDownload links:\r\nTo download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-2.6.0.tar.gz\".

        "body": "There are no major changes between 2.5b1 and 2.5.0. If you are upgrading from version 2.4.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 2.5b1 (included below).\n\n## Notable fixes and improvements\n- The Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up and Page Down keys work in Vi-style key bindings (#3731).\n\n---\n\nThe release notes for fish 2.5b1 are as follows:\n\n## Platform Changes\n\nStarting with version 2.5, fish requires a more up-to-date version of C++, specifically C++11 (from 2011). This affects some older platforms:\n\n### Linux\n\nFor users building from source, GCC's g++ 4.8 or later, or LLVM's clang 3.3 or later, are known to work. Older platforms may require a newer compiler installed.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the complexity of the toolchain, binary packages are no longer published by the fish-shell developers for the following platforms:\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 5 & 6 for 64-bit builds\n- Ubuntu 12.04 (EoLTS April 2017)\n- Debian 7 (EoLTS May 2018)\n\nInstalling newer version of fish on these systems will require building from source.\n\n### OS X SnowLeopard\n\nStarting with version 2.5, fish requires a C++11 standard library on OS X 10.6 (\"SnowLeopard\"). If this library is not installed, you will see this error: `dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib`\n\nMacPorts is the easiest way to obtain this library. After installing the SnowLeopard MacPorts release from the install page, run:\n\n```\nsudo port -v install libcxx\n```\n\nNow fish should launch successfully. (Please open an issue if it does not.)\n\nThis is only necessary on 10.6. OS X 10.7 and later include the required library by default.\n\n## Other significant changes\n- Attempting to exit with running processes in the background produces a warning, then signals them to terminate if a second attempt to exit is made. This brings the behaviour for running background processes into line with stopped processes. (#3497)\n- `random` can now have start, stop and step values specified, or the new `choice` subcommand can be used to pick an argument from a list (#3619).\n- A new key bindings preset, `fish_hybrid_key_bindings`, including all the Emacs-style and Vi-style bindings, which behaves like `fish_vi_key_bindings` in fish 2.3.0 (#3556).\n- `function` now returns an error when called with invalid options, rather than defining the function anyway (#3574). This was a regression present in fish 2.3 and 2.4.0.\n- fish no longer prints a warning when it identifies a running instance of an old version (2.1.0 and earlier). Changes to universal variables may not propagate between these old versions and 2.5b1.\n- Improved compatiblity with Android (#3585), MSYS/mingw (#2360), Solaris (#3456, #3340)\n- Like other shells, the `test` builting now returns an error for numeric operations on invalid integers (#3346, #3581).\n- `complete` no longer recognises `--authoritative` and `--unauthoritative` options, and they are marked as obsolete.\n- `status` accepts subcommands, and should be used like `status is-interactive`. The old options continue to be supported for the foreseeable future (#3526), although only one subcommand or option can be specified at a time.\n- Selection mode (used with \"begin-selection\") no longer selects a character the cursor does not move over (#3684).\n- List indexes are handled better, and a bit more liberally in some cases (`echo $PATH[1 .. 3]` is now valid) (#3579).\n- The `fish_mode_prompt` function is now simply a stub around `fish_default_mode_prompt`, which allows the mode prompt to be included more easily in customised prompt functions (#3641).\n\n## Notable fixes and improvements\n- `alias`, run without options or arguments, lists all defined aliases, and aliases now include a description in the function signature that identifies them.\n- `complete` accepts empty strings as descriptions (#3557).\n- `command` accepts `-q`/`--quiet` in combination with `--search` (#3591), providing a simple way of checking whether a command exists in scripts.\n- Abbreviations can now be renamed with `abbr --rename OLD_KEY NEW_KEY` (#3610).\n- The command synopses printed by `--help` options work better with copying and pasting (#2673).\n- `help` launches the browser specified by the `$fish_help_browser variable` if it is set (#3131).\n- History merging could lose items under certain circumstances and is now fixed (#3496).\n- The `$status` variable is now set to 123 when a syntactically invalid command is entered (#3616).\n- Exiting fish now signals all background processes to terminate, not just stopped jobs (#3497).\n- A new `prompt_hostname` function which prints a hostname suitable for use in prompts (#3482).\n- The `__fish_man_page` function (bound to Alt-h by default) now tries to recognize subcommands (e.g. `git add` will now open the \"git-add\" man page) (#3678).\n- A new function `edit_command_buffer` (bound to Alt-e & Alt-v by default) to edit the command buffer in an external editor (#1215, #3627).\n- `set_color` now supports italics (`--italics`), dim (`--dim`) and reverse (`--reverse`) modes (#3650).\n- Filesystems with very slow locking (eg incorrectly-configured NFS) will no longer slow fish down (#685).\n- Improved completions for `apt` (#3695), `fusermount` (#3642), `make` (#3628), `netctl-auto` (#3378), `nmcli` (#3648), `pygmentize` (#3378), and `tar` (#3719).\n- Added completions for:\n  - `VBoxHeadless` (#3378)\n  - `VBoxSDL` (#3378)\n  - `base64` (#3378)\n  - `caffeinate` (#3524)\n  - `dconf` (#3638)\n  - `dig` (#3495)\n  - `dpkg-reconfigure` (#3521 & #3522)\n  - `feh` (#3378)\n  - `launchctl` (#3682)\n  - `lxc` (#3554 & #3564),\n  - `mddiagnose` (#3524)\n  - `mdfind` (#3524)\n  - `mdimport`  (#3524)\n  - `mdls` (#3524)\n  - `mdutil` (#3524)\n  - `mkvextract` (#3492)\n  - `nvram` (#3524)\n  - `objdump` (#3378)\n  - `sysbench` (#3491)\n  - `tmutil` (#3524)\n\nDownload links: to download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-2.5.0.tar.gz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly.\n",

This release does not contain all the changes to fish since the last release, but fixes a number of issues directly affecting users at present and includes a small number of new features.\n\n## Significant changes\n- A new `fish_key_reader` binary for decoding interactive keypresses (#2991).\n- `fish_mode_prompt` has been updated to reflect the changes in the way the Vi input mode is set up (#3067), making this more reliable.\n- `fish_config` can now properly be launched from the OS X app bundle (#3140).\n\n## Notable fixes and improvements\n- Extra lines were sometimes inserted into the output under Windows (Cygwin and Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux) due to TTY timestamps not being updated (#2859).\n- The `string` builtin's `match` mode now handles the combination of `-rnv` (match, invert and count) correctly (#3098).\n- Improvements to TTY special character handling (#3064), locale handling (#3124) and terminal environment variable handling (#3060).\n- Work towards handling the terminal modes for external commands launched from initialisation files (#2980).\n- Ease the upgrade path from fish 2.2.0 and before by warning users to restart fish if the `string` builtin is not available (#3057).\n- `type -a` now syntax-colorizes function source output.\n- Added completions for `alsamixer`, `godoc`, `gofmt`, `goimports`, `gorename`, `lscpu`, `mkdir`, `modinfo`, `netctl-auto`, `poweroff`, `termite`, `udisksctl` and `xz` (#3123).\n- Improved completions for `apt` (#3097), `aura` (#3102),`git` (#3114), `npm` (#3158), `string` and `suspend` (#3154).\n- Improved completion of hostnames via ssh_config (#3146), used for numerous commands (ssh, rsync, svn, systemd tools, ...)\n",

This builtin will measure, split, search and replace text strings, including using regular expressions. It can also be used to turn lists into plain strings using `join`. `string` can be used in place of `sed`, `grep`, `tr`, `cut`, and `awk` in many situations. (#2296)\n- After seeing an escape character wait up to 300ms for an additional character. This is consistent with readline (e.g. bash) and can be configured via the fish_escape_delay_ms variable. This allows using escape as the Meta modifier. (#1356)\n- Add new directories for vendor functions and configuration snippets (#2498)\n- A new `fish_realpath` builtin and associated function to allow the use of `realpath` even on those platforms that don't ship an appropriate command (#2932).\n- Alt-# toggles the current command line between commented and uncommented states, making it easy to save a command in history without executing it.\n- The `fish_vi_mode` function is now deprecated in favour of `fish_vi_key_bindings`.\n\n## Backward-incompatible changes<a id=\"sec-2\" name=\"sec-2\"></a>\n-   Unmatched globs will now cause an error, except when used with `for`, `set` or `count` (#2719, #2394)\n-   `and` and `or` will now bind to the closest `if` or `while`, allowing compound conditions without `begin` and `end` (#1428)\n-   `set -ql` now searches up to function scope for variables (#2502)\n-   `status -f` will now behave the same when run as the main script or using `source` (#2643)\n-   `source` no longer puts the file name in `$argv` if no arguments are given (#139)\n\n## Other notable fixes and improvements<a id=\"sec-3\" name=\"sec-3\"></a>\n-   Fish no longer silences errors in config.fish (#2702)\n-   Move the history file to $XDG_DATA_HOME/fish (or ~/.local/share if it has not been set)\n-   Directory autosuggestions will now descend as far as possible if there is only one child directory (#2531)\n-   Add support for bright colors (#1464)\n-   Allow Ctrl-J (\\cj) to be bound separately from Ctrl-M (\\cm) (#217)\n-   psub now has a \"-s\"/\"&#x2013;suffix\" option to name the temporary file with that suffix\n-   Enable 24-bit colors on select terminals (#2495)\n-   Support for SVN status in the prompt (#2582)\n-   Mercurial and SVN support have been added to the Classic + Git (now Classic + VCS) prompt (via the new __fish_vcs_prompt function) (#2592)\n-   export now handles variables with a \"=\" in the value (#2403)\n-   Avoid confusing the terminal line driver with non-printing characters in `fish_title` (#2453).\n-   New completions for:\n  -   alsactl\n  -   Archlinux's asp, makepkg\n  -   Atom's apm (#2390)\n  -   entr - the \"Event Notify Test Runner\" (#2265)\n  -   Fedora's dnf (#2638)\n  -   OSX diskutil (#2738)\n  -   pkgng (#2395)\n  -   pulseaudio's pacmd and pactl\n  -   rmmod (#3007)\n  -   rust's rustc and cargo (#2409)\n  -   sysctl (#2214)\n  -   systemd's machinectl (#2158), busctl (#2144), systemd-nspawn, systemd-analyze, localectl, timedatectl\n  -   and more\n-   Fish no longer has a function called sgrep, freeing it for user customization (#2245)\n-   A rewrite of the completions for cd, fixing a few bugs (#2299, #2300, #562)\n-   Linux VTs now run in a simplified mode to avoid issues (#2311)\n-   The vi-bindings now inherit from the emacs bindings\n-   Fish will also execute fish_user_key_bindings when in vi-mode\n-   `funced` will now also check $VISUAL (#2268)\n-   A new `suspend` function (#2269)\n-   Subcommand completion now works better with split /usr (#2141)\n-   The command-not-found-handler can now be overridden by defining a function called __fish_command_not_found_handler in config.fish (#2331)\n-   A few fixes to the Sorin theme\n-   PWD shortening in the prompt can now be configured via the fish_prompt_pwd_dir_length variable, set to the length per path component (#2473)\n-   fish now ships a skeleton file for /etc/fish/config.fish that only contains some documentation, the included code has been moved to the corresponding file in /usr (#2799)\n",

        "body": "## Release Notes for fish 2.2.0 (released July 12, 2015)\n\n### Significant changes\n- Abbreviations: the new `abbr` command allows for interactively-expanded abbreviations, allowing quick access to frequently-used commands (#731).\n- Vi mode: run `fish_vi_mode` to switch fish into the key bindings and prompt familiar to users of the Vi editor (#65).\n- New inline and interactive pager, which will be familiar to users of zsh (#291).\n- Underlying architectural changes: the `fishd` universal variable server has been removed as it was a source of many bugs and security problems. Notably, old fish sessions will not be able to communicate universal variable changes with new fish sessions. For best results, restart all running instances of `fish`.\n- The web-based configuration tool has been redesigned, featuring a prompt theme chooser and other improvements.\n- New German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Chinese translations.\n\n### Backward-incompatible changes\n\nThese are kept to a minimum, but either change undocumented features or are too hard to use in their existing forms. These changes may break existing scripts.\n- `commandline` no longer interprets functions \"in reverse\", instead behaving as expected (#1567).\n- The previously-undocumented `CMD_DURATION` variable is now set for all commands and contains the execution time of the last command in milliseconds (#1585). It is no longer exported to other commands (#1896).\n- `if` / `else` conditional statements now return values consistent with the Single Unix Specification, like other shells (#1443).\n- A new \"top-level\" local scope has been added, allowing local variables declared on the commandline to be visible to subsequent commands. (#1908)\n\n### Other notable fixes and improvements\n- New documentation design (#1662), which requires a Doxygen version 1.8.7 or newer to build.\n- Fish now defines a default directory for other packages to provide completions. By default this is `/usr/share/fish/vendor-completions.d`; on systems with `pkgconfig` installed this path is discoverable with `pkg-config --variable completionsdir fish`.\n- A new parser removes many bugs; all existing syntax should keep working.\n- New `fish_preexec` and `fish_postexec` events are fired before and after job execution respectively (#1549).\n- Unmatched wildcards no longer prevent a job from running. Wildcards used interactively will still print an error, but the job will proceed and the wildcard will expand to zero arguments (#1482). \n- The `.` command is deprecated and the `source` command is preferred (#310).\n- `bind` supports \"bind modes\", which allows bindings to be set for a particular named mode, to support the implementation of Vi mode.\n- A new `export` alias, which behaves like other shells (#1833).\n- `command` has a new `--search` option to print the name of the disk file that would be executed, like other shells' `command -v` (#1540).\n- `commandline` has a new `--paging-mode` option to support the new pager.\n- `complete` has a new `--wraps` option, which allows a command to (recursively) inherit the completions of a wrapped command (#393), and `complete -e` now correctly erases completions (#380).\n- Completions are now generated from manual pages by default on the first run of fish (#997).\n- `fish_indent` can now produce colorized (`--ansi`) and HTML (`--html`) output (#1827).\n- `functions --erase` now prevents autoloaded functions from being reloaded in the current session.\n- `history` has a new `--merge` option, to incorporate history from other sessions into the current session (#825).\n- `jobs` returns 1 if there are no active jobs (#1484).\n- `read` has several new options:\n  - `--array` to break input into an array (#1540)\n  - `--null` to break lines on NUL characters rather than newlines (#1694)\n  - `--nchars` to read a specific number of characters (#1616) \n  - `--right-prompt` to display a right-hand-side prompt during interactive read (#1698).\n- `type` has a new `-q` option to suppress output (#1540 and, like other shells, `type -a` now prints all matches for a command (#261).\n- Pressing F1 now shows the manual page for the current command (#1063).\n- `fish_title` functions have access to the arguments of the currently running argument as `$argv[1]` (#1542).\n- The OS command-not-found handler is used on Arch Linux (#1925), nixOS (#1852), openSUSE and Fedora (#1280).\n- `Alt`+`.` searches backwards in the token history, mapping to the same behavior as inserting the last argument of the previous command, like other shells (#89).\n- The `SHLVL` environment variable is incremented correctly (#1634 & #1693).\n- Added completions for `adb` (#1165 & #1211), `apt` (#2018), `aura` (#1292), `composer` (#1607), `cygport` (#1841), `dropbox` (#1533), `elixir` (#1167), `fossil`, `heroku` (#1790), `iex` (#1167), `kitchen` (#2000), `nix` (#1167), `node`/`npm` (#1566), `opam` (#1615), `setfacl` (#1752), `tmuxinator` (#1863), and `yast2` (#1739).\n- Improved completions for `brew` (#1090 & #1810), `bundler` (#1779), `cd` (#1135), `emerge` (#1840),`git` (#1680, #1834 & #1951), `man` (#960), `modprobe` (#1124), `pacman` (#1292), `rpm` (#1236), `rsync` (#1872), `scp` (#1145), `ssh` (#1234), `sshfs` (#1268), `systemctl` (#1462, #1950 & #1972), `tmux` (#1853), `vagrant` (#1748), `yum` (#1269), and `zypper` (#1787).\n",

To repair the filesystem, you can boot into Recovery Mode and use Repair Disk from Disk Utility. Linux and versions of OS X prior to Yosemite are believed to be unaffected.\n\nThere are no other changes in this release. \n",

On most systems, there will be no further action required. Note that some environments (where `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set), such as Fedora 20, will require a restart of all running fish processes before universal variables work as intended.\n\nDistributors are highly encouraged to call `killall fishd`, `pkill fishd` or similar in installation scripts, or to warn their users to do so.\n\n### Security fixes\n- The fish_config web interface now uses an authentication token to protect requests and only responds to requests from the local machine with this token, preventing a remote code execution attack. (closing CVE-2014-2914). #1438 \n- `psub` and `funced` are no longer vulnerable to attacks which allow local privilege escalation and data tampering (closing CVE-2014-2906 and CVE-2014-3856). #1437 \n- `fishd` uses a secure path for its socket, preventing a local privilege escalation attack (closing CVE-2014-2905). #1436 \n- `__fish_print_packages` is no longer vulnerable to attacks which would allow local privilege escalation and data tampering (closing CVE-2014-3219). #1440\n\n### Other fixes\n- `fishd` now ignores SIGPIPE, fixing crashes using tools like GNU Parallel and which occurred more often as a result of the other `fishd` changes. #1084 & #1690 \n\nThe SHA-1 sum for the official source tarball is 8f97f39b92ea7dfef1f464b18e304045bf37546d.\n",

        "body": "## Significant Changes\r\n- **Tab completions will fuzzy-match files.** #568\r\n  \r\n  When tab-completing a file, fish will first attempt prefix matches (`foo` matches `foobar`), then substring matches (`ooba` matches `foobar`), and lastly subsequence matches (`fbr` matches `foobar`). For example, in a directory with files foo1.txt, foo2.txt, foo3.txt\u2026, you can type only the numeric part and hit tab to fill in the rest.\r\n  \r\n  This feature is implemented for files and executables. It is not yet implemented for options (like `--foobar`), and not yet implemented across path components (like `/u/l/b` to match `/usr/local/bin`).\r\n- **Redirections now work better across pipelines.** #110, #877\r\n  \r\n  In particular, you can pipe stderr and stdout together, for example, with `cmd ^&1 | tee log.txt`, or the more familiar `cmd 2>&1 | tee log.txt`.\r\n- **A single `%` now expands to the last job backgrounded.** #1008\r\n  \r\n  Previously, a single `%` would pid-expand to either all backgrounded jobs, or all jobs owned by your user. Now it expands to the last job backgrounded. If no job is in the background, it will fail to expand. In particular, `fg %` can be used to put the most recent background job in the foreground.\r\n\r\n## Other Notable Fixes\r\n- alt-U and alt+C now uppercase and capitalize words, respectively. #995\r\n- VTE based terminals should now know the working directory. #906\r\n- The autotools build now works on Mavericks. #968\r\n- The end-of-line binding (ctrl+E) now accepts autosuggestions. #932\r\n- Directories in `/etc/paths` (used on OS X) are now prepended instead of appended, similar to other shells. #927\r\n- Option-right-arrow (used for partial autosuggestion completion) now works on iTerm2. #920\r\n- Tab completions now work properly within nested subcommands. #913\r\n- `printf` supports \\e, the escape character. #910\r\n- `fish_config history` no longer shows duplicate items. #900\r\n- `$fish_user_paths` is now prepended to $PATH instead of appended. #888\r\n- Jobs complete when all processes complete. #876\r\n  \r\n  For example, in previous versions of fish, `sleep 10 | echo Done` returns control immediately, because echo does not read from stdin. Now it does not complete until sleep exits (presumably after 10 seconds).\r\n- Better error reporting for square brackets. #875\r\n- fish no longer tries to add `/bin` to `$PATH` unless PATH is totally empty. #852\r\n- History token substitution (alt-up) now works correctly inside subshells. #833\r\n- Flow control is now disabled, freeing up ctrl-S and ctrl-Q for other uses. #814\r\n- sh-style variable setting like `foo=bar` now produces better error messages. #809\r\n- Commands with wildcards no longer produce autosuggestions. #785\r\n- funced no longer freaks out when supplied with no arguments. #780\r\n- fish.app now works correctly in a directory containing spaces. #774\r\n- Tab completion cycling no longer occasionally fails to repaint. #765\r\n- Comments now work in eval'd strings. #684\r\n- History search (up-arrow) now shows the item matching the autosuggestion, if that autosuggestion was truncated. #650\r\n- Ctrl-T now transposes characters, as in other shells. #128\r\n",

        "body": "## Significant Changes\n- **Command substitutions now modify `$status` #547.**\n  Previously the exit status of command substitutions (like `(pwd)`) was ignored; however now it modifies $status. Furthermore, the `set` command now only sets $status on failure; it is untouched on success. This allows for the following pattern:\n  \n  ``` sh\n  if set python_path (which python)\n     ...\n  end\n  ```\n  \n  Because set does not modify $status on success, the if branch effectively tests whether `which` succeeded, and if so, whether the `set` also succeeded.\n- **Improvements to $PATH handling.**\n  - There is a new variable, `$fish_user_paths`, which can be set universally, and whose contents are appended to $PATH #527\n  - /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d are now respected on OS X\n  - fish no longer modifies $PATH to find its own binaries\n- **Long lines no longer use ellipsis for line breaks**, and copy and paste\n  should no longer include a newline even if the line was broken #300\n- **New syntax for index ranges** (sometimes known as \"slices\") #212\n- **fish now supports an `else if` statement** #134\n- **Process and pid completion now works on OS X** #129\n- **fish is now relocatable**, and no longer depends on compiled-in paths #125\n- **fish now supports a right prompt (RPROMPT)** through the fish_right_prompt function #80\n- **fish now uses posix_spawn instead of fork when possible**, which is much faster on BSD and OS X #11\n\n## Other Notable Fixes\n- Updated VCS completions (darcs, cvs, svn, etc.)\n- Avoid calling getcwd on the main thread, as it can hang #696\n- Control-D (forward delete) no longer stops at a period #667\n- Completions for many new commands\n- fish now respects rxvt's unique keybindings #657\n- xsel is no longer built as part of fish. It will still be invoked if installed separately #633\n- __fish_filter_mime no longer spews #628\n- The --no-execute option to fish no longer falls over when reaching the end of a block #624\n- fish_config knows how to find fish even if it's not in the $PATH #621\n- A leading space now prevents writing to history, as is done in bash and zsh #615\n- Hitting enter after a backslash only goes to a new line if it is followed by whitespace or the end of the line #613\n- printf is now a builtin #611\n- Event handlers should no longer fire if signals are blocked #608\n- set_color is now a builtin #578\n- man page completions are now located in a new generated_completions directory, instead of your completions directory #576\n- tab now clears autosuggestions #561\n- tab completion from within a pair of quotes now attempts to \"appropriate\" the closing quote #552\n- $EDITOR can now be a list: for example, `set EDITOR gvim -f`) #541\n- `case` bodies are now indented #530\n- The profile switch `-p` no longer crashes #517\n- You can now control-C out of `read` #516\n- `umask` is now functional on OS X #515\n- Avoid calling getpwnam on the main thread, as it can hang #512\n- Alt-F or Alt-right-arrow (Option-F or option-right-arrow) now accepts one word of an autosuggestion #435\n- Setting fish as your login shell no longer kills OpenSUSE #367\n- Backslashes now join lines, instead of creating multiple commands #347\n- echo now implements the -e flag to interpret escapes #337\n- When the last token in the user's input contains capital letters, use its case in preference to that of the autosuggestion #335\n- Descriptions now have their own muted color #279\n- Wildcards beginning with a . (for example, `ls .*`) no longer match . and .. #270\n- Recursive wildcards now handle symlink loops #268\n- You can now delete history items from the fish_config web interface #250\n- The OS X build now weak links `wcsdup` and `wcscasecmp` #240\n- fish now saves and restores the process group, which prevents certain processes from being erroneously reported as stopped #197\n- funced now takes an editor option #187\n- Alternating row colors are available in fish pager through `fish_pager_color_secondary` #186\n- Universal variable values are now stored based on your MAC address, not your hostname #183\n- The caret ^ now only does a stderr redirection if it is the first character of a token, making git users happy #168\n- Autosuggestions will no longer cause line wrapping #167\n- Better handling of Unicode combining characters #155\n- fish SIGHUPs processes more often #138\n- fish no longer causes `sudo` to ask for a password every time\n- fish behaves better under Midnight Commander #121\n- `set -e` no longer crashes #100\n- fish now will automatically import history from bash, if there is no fish history #66\n- Backslashed-newlines inside quoted strings now behave more intuitively #52\n- Tab titles should be shown correctly in iTerm2 #47\n- scp remote path completion now sometimes works #42\n- The `read` builtin no longer shows autosuggestions #29\n- Custom key bindings can now be set via the `fish_user_key_bindings` function #21\n- All Python scripts now run correctly under both Python 2 and Python 3 #14\n- The \"accept autosuggestion\" key can now be configured #19\n- Autosuggestions will no longer suggest invalid commands #6\n",
